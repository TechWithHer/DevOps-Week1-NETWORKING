Test port connectivity (like Telnet, but better)
Transfer files between machines
Act as a server or a client
Do banner grabbing, port scanning, and more
15. iptables
16. ifplugstatus
17. route
18. nmap: Discover devices on a network
Scan open ports

24. ethtool : Shows detailed Ethernet stats, link speed (handy for server checks)
25. tcdump : Packet capture utility (can add option to detect DNS or ICMP issues)
26. speedtest-cli: Test internet speed (optional, helps in slow-connection debugging)
