Note: Its for LINUX Servers 

iptables: iptables is a Linux firewall tool used to set up, maintain, and inspect the tables of IP packet filter rules in the Linux kernel. It controls network traffic and firewall rules

snort: Snort is a network intrusion detection and prevention system (IDS/IPS). It monitors network traffic for suspicious activities and alerts or blocks them

Wireshark: It is a graphical network protocol analyzer. It captures network packets and lets you inspect them in detail — super useful for debugging network issues.

ufw: UFW stands for Uncomplicated Firewall. It’s a user-friendly command-line interface to manage Linux firewall rules.  Built on top of iptables, but simpler to use, especially for beginners or basic server setups.
